                     🛒 Simple Shopping List App 🛒

🚀 About the Project
The Simple Shopping List App is a user-friendly mobile application designed to help you easily manage your grocery or shopping needs. It allows you to quickly register items along with their quantities, and provides functionalities to effortlessly edit or delete items as your shopping plans evolve. Say goodbye to forgotten items or paper lists!

Why this project?
I built this project to streamline the everyday task of creating and managing shopping lists. Traditional paper lists can get lost or become messy, and more complex apps often have too many features. My goal was to create a straightforward, intuitive, and efficient digital shopping list that focuses on the essentials: adding items, tracking quantities, and making quick adjustments, ensuring a smooth and organized shopping experience.

1. Add Items with Quantity: Easily add new items to your shopping list, specifying the name of the item and the desired quantity.

2. Edit Existing Items: Modify item names or quantities with a simple tap, allowing for flexible adjustments to your list.

3. Delete Items: Remove items from your list that you no longer need or have already purchased.

4.Clear and Concise List View: See all your registered items and their quantities at a glance in a clean, uncluttered interface.
